# Smart devices traffic analysis
A data science project based on network traffic generated by IoT devices
This project was developed as an assignment for the final project of **Internet of Things** class (INF16025) taught at **UFES (Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo)**.  
A model that classifies the type of the smart device is builtin on top of a dataset that represents the network traffic of a single device in an arbitrary range of time. 
# The dataset
The dataset is provided in the `data` directory inside the repository, it was taken from chapter 5 of `Machine learning cookbook for cyber security` that can be found at (GitHub)[https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Machine-Learning-for-Cybersecurity-Cookbook/tree/master/Chapter05/IoT%20Device%20Type%20Identification%20Using%20Machine%20Learning].
# The analysis
The data analysis as well as the model is available in a *jupyter notebook* located at `src/smart_devices_traffic_analysis.ipnyb`.
More details can be seen at the article and presentation at `media` directory.
